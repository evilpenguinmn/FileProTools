This is the FileProTools project at github.com

The intention here is to build a collection of tools to read and convert filePro data
and applications to other forms. No judgement implied here. The authors have simply been
asked frequently to help convert such applications to other databases and application
stacks ranging from Oracle/Java to MySQL/PHP. The primary motivation seems to be
lack of avilable or affordable filePro skilled persons.

The cpp code in this project is NOT under active development, but is included for
completeness.

The primary effort is going into the perl code for the sake of portability.
