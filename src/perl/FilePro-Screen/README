FilePro-Screen version 0.01
===========================

This module supports reading FilePro "screen" files. These are the files
that implement screens, reports, and "processing" (what most of us would
think of as "programming," either on demand or on a schedule).

The purpose of the module is to give you perl data structures you can
use to analyze the contents of such files. This may be to implement their
functionality yourself in a perl program, to document the dependencies
between screens, reports, and data, to convert them to web pages, whatever.

This module is just designed to read 'em in and display 'em.
